# Project-Athena

Project Athena is currently an open source bot that is used to enhance my personal learning of JavaScript.
The bots prefix is c.
It currently features the following: 

## Features

_Italisized_ means it's a slash command, **bolded** means it's a normal command. One command can have both!
- _**Ping command**_ (Bot responds with pong)
- _Ban command_
- _Kick command_
- _Timeout command_


More features are planned and all features from now on will be ported to slash commands.

## Notes

It should be noted that the project is split in 2 primary branches, the main branch and the development branch. I highly suggest only using the main branch for personal use.

### Main
The main branch is used for comitts that are finalized with no major bugs (hopefully none) and have no WIP features (may have some of the structure for them) This is the branch you should use mainly!

### Development
The development branch is used for incomplete features or features with major bugs and issues. Only use this if you want to try and fix my messy and broken code.
